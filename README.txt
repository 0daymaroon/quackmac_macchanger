H3ll0 fri3nd, quackmac.py is a simple linux mac changer script coded by me in python3 using subprocess module. You have to enter interface and a new valid mac address you want and it will be changed in a flash! Mac address can also be entered without colons just like 121000101111 insted of 12:10:00:10:11:11. To run, just open terminal in the folder you saved the file and type "python3 ./quackmac.py"
Remember to give permission to execute the script and Make sure you have installed python3 in your linux system. This script doesn't require internet access.


Thanks!
